            <h1>Why Build It Yourself?</h1>
            <img src="images/image.jpg" alt="">
            <p>It might seem daunting to build your own PC, but the truth is it's actually quite easy.</p>
            <p>It only requires buying parts, installing them into the right slots, and hooking them up with cables. It's almost like Lego, but a bit more fiddly, and you'll need a screwdriver for some parts.</p>
            <p>There are a ton of videos and other online resources to help you along the way. But if you're still on the fence, here are three very good reasons you should build your next computer from the ground up.</p>
            <h2>It costs a lot less</h2>
            <p>To test this theory out, I compared the price of a high-end gaming PC from a well-known brand with good quality equivalent parts with the same specifications from popular sites where you can buy PC parts, like Newegg and Amazon.</p>
            <p>The high-end brand-name PC retails at $3,055. Meanwhile, the total for the parts I found on Newegg and Amazon were in the $1,600 range. In other words, you can simply build the PC you want with all the same parts as the brand-name PC but it'll cost about half as much yet perform just as well.</p>
            <h2>You can pick exactly which parts you want and need</h2>
            <p>As I was looking through the different options for brand-name PCs you can buy, I noticed there weren't actually that many to choose from. You're limited by what the company offers, basically.</p>

            For example, I couldn't opt for less storage with one of the brand-name PCs. I had to get an SSD and regular hard drive combo, with the only other storage options being more expensive. Personally, all I need is one SSD since I have no need for a regular hard drive, yet I'd still be forced to pay for the hard drive if I bought the brand-name PC.


            By picking the parts yourself you also know exactly what you're getting, and you're paying for as much as you need. Not more, not less. For brand-name PC's, it's not quite as clear what parts companies use, so you're never really sure whether you're overpaying for something you don't need, or if you're getting parts that don't do what you want. 

            It's extremely satisfying
            This GIF just about sums up the experience:


            It is extremely satisfying to put hand-picked parts together and run the Windows operating system, as well as apps and games. You can look at your final product and say "I made that," not some company like Samsung, Acer, or HP.

            You could even give your PC some tasty marketing phrases, like "hand-made" and "small batch," as there's no computer out there that's exactly like yours. Well, maybe a few are pretty similar, but at least it didn't come off a factory line where thousands of other PCs with the exact same look and specs were made.


            One of the worst feelings of owning a computer is when something goes wrong — it doesn't boot up, for example — and you can't figure out what's wrong with it. It might have been a defective part coming off the production line, and you were the unlucky person to receive that particular part. Sure, you can find a popular online marketplace to buy a new part to replace the defective one, but then you need to wait for it to arrive in the mail.

            When you build your own PC, it's easier to see what's gone wrong because you become familiar with each part. As I show in my guide for building your own high-end PC, my computer wouldn't boot the first time I tried it, but I was able to find the issue, look it up, and find a solution.

            <h1>Picking The Parts</h1>
            <p>No matter what your experience level is, you should use PCPartPicker. Not only does it have everything you’ll need to buy, but it lets you build your PC piece by piece right there on the website, making sure all your hardware will play nicely together. They even have a few example builds you can tweak to your liking if you want.</p>
            <p>Regardless of what kind of PC you’re building (home office or gaming), the components you need are going to be the same. You’ll need a motherboard, a CPU, storage, memory, a power supply, a case, and a monitor. The only thing you might not need if you're mostly using this PC for home office tasks is a GPU, but it's necessary for photo or video editing and gaming. That’s a lot of stuff. Here’s a little breakdown of what each component does, and some hardware recommendations.</p>
            <h2>Motherboard</h2>
            Every other component plugs into this circuit board. It’s the highway they use to communicate and collaborate. They come in different sizes and configurations, and each one looks a little different, but they all fill the same function.
            
            Suggested Hardware
            MSI MPG Z490. This one is great for Intel processors.
            ASUS ROG Strix B450-F: If you are buying an AMD processor (more on that below), get this one.
            Processor
            This is the brain of your computer. It sockets directly into the motherboard, and it’s the single most important component of your PC. But that doesn’t mean it has to be the most expensive. We’ll get to that later. If the CPU doesn't mention including thermal paste, make sure to get some too. This one will do.
            
            Suggested Hardware
            Intel Core i7-10700K 8-Core 3.8GHz: This is an excellent choice for high-end systems.
            AMD Ryzen 3 3200G 4-Core 3.6GHz: AMD's processor is a solid pick if you're on a tighter budget.
            Graphics Card
            If you’re planning on playing games on this PC, you’ll need a graphics processing unit, or GPU (also called a graphics card). This is a specialized processor that’s designed and optimized for handling primarily visual data like the graphics in games. It's also used in video and photo editing, and other graphics-intensive tasks.
            
            Suggested Hardware
            MSI GeForce GTX 1660: This one is a good pick for gaming on a budget.
            MSI Radeon RX 570: The RX 570 is getting a little long in the tooth, but it's a great buy for AMD fans.
            MSI GeForce RTX 2060: If you're looking to get into high-end gaming, this card strikes a good balance between power and price.
            Storage
            This is your PC’s walk-in closet. This is where you store all your files, your games, your movies, your documents, your photos, your everything. You can always add more storage later if you need it.
            
            Suggested Hardware
            WD Blue 1 TB Internal SSD: It's quick, with plenty of storage space.
            Memory
            You’ll see a lot of the same terms when you’re looking at memory and storage, but they’re very different. Memory is more like that one table you toss things on to deal with later. It’s scratch paper; it’s short-term. It’s very important, though, because software uses memory to cache (temporarily store) data in a place it can be retrieved very quickly.
            
            Suggested Hardware
            G.Skill Ripjaws V Series 32 GB 288-Pin RAM: With this much RAM, you should be pretty well set for everyday tasks and gaming.
            Power Supply
            Your power supply is a little box that keeps the electricity running to each and every component. It determines how quick and powerful your PC can be. The faster it is, the more power it needs, and you always want to have a little more than you need, just in case.
            
            Suggested Hardware
            EVGA SuperNOVA 750 GA Power Supply: You should always err on the side of having more power than you need, and this unit will provide exactly that.
            Case
            Your case is just what it sounds like. It’s a metal box. It might be covered in glass panels and etched aluminum, but inside it’s just a big metal box that holds everything together.
            
            Suggested Hardware
            Corsair Obsidian Series ATX Full Tower: There are lots of different kinds of cases out there, some are super small, others are enormous. And your decision will ultimately come down to the design you like as much as anything else. If you're unsure what to get, this one from Corsair is great for your first build. Other case manufacturers we like are NZXT, Fractal, Phanteks, Cooler Master, and Lian Li.
            Operating System
            One thing to remember is that when you build a PC, you don't automatically have Windows included. You'll have to buy a license from Microsoft or another vendor and make a USB key to install it.
